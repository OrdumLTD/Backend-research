### **1.1 Fat contract design**
- **Aim**
  - Define and evaluate the design based on user experience.
  - Define the design effectiveness based on the cost of operation ( fees ).
 
- #### Methodologies ####
  - Qualitative ( Discussion with other team including Phala ).
  
---
### **1.2 Data storage**
- #### Aim ####
  - Define and evaluate storage layout in the contract.
  - Define and evaluate external storage infrastructures ( Crust and others ). </br>
  **Both include database reads and writes , cost of operations and user experience**
  
---
### **1.3 Evaluate Limitations**
- #### Aim ####
  - Evaluate short comings of Fat Contracts e.g data races.
  - Evaluate uptime and execution of Fat Contract.
  - Evaluate portability of the issued certificates.
